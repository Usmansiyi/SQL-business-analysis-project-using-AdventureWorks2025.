🔹 Key Insights
🧾 Sales Performance & Revenue

Revenue shows a consistent upward trend over time.

Online sales are growing faster than reseller sales, indicating a shift toward digital channels.

A small number of products and territories contribute a large share of total revenue.

Sales exhibit clear seasonal patterns.

👥 Customer Analytics

Repeat customers generate most of the revenue.

High-value customers are concentrated in specific segments.

A portion of customers has been inactive for extended periods, indicating churn risk.

Revenue distribution follows a Pareto (80/20) pattern.

📦 Product & Inventory Analysis

A limited set of products drives most sales volume.

Some products generate high revenue but low profit margins.

Slow-moving inventory exists in certain categories, increasing holding costs.

Stock levels for some products frequently fall below reorder points.

🏭 Operations & Supply Chain

Vendor lead times vary significantly.

A small group of suppliers accounts for most delivery delays.

Fulfillment time directly affects order performance.

💰 Profitability & Cost Analysis

Profit is unevenly distributed across products and territories.

Discounts significantly reduce margins for selected high-volume products.

Several high-revenue products contribute relatively low profit.

A small number of customers and products generate minimal or negative profit.

🌍 Geographic & Territory Insights

Revenue is concentrated in a few regions.

Certain territories show stronger growth potential than others.

Average order value differs significantly by region.

📊 Advanced & Analytical Findings

Sales display consistent year-over-year growth patterns.

Rolling averages reveal long-term trends beyond short-term fluctuations.

Pareto analysis confirms that a minority of customers and products drive most revenue.

Churn-risk customers can be identified using recency and frequency behavior.

🧠 Executive-Level Conclusions

Business growth is increasingly driven by online sales channels.

Margin optimization should focus on low-margin, high-volume products.

Customer retention represents a major opportunity for revenue stability.

Vendor performance improvements can reduce operational inefficiencies.

Expansion efforts should prioritize high-growth regions.

✅ Business Recommendations

Increase investment in digital and online sales channels.

Review discount strategies for low-margin products.

Improve inventory planning for slow-moving and frequently out-of-stock items.

Implement retention strategies for high-value inactive customers.

Reassess vendor contracts with consistently long lead times.
